We explore different ways of measuring brain activity non-invasively. 

Our first distinction is based on the type of brain activity being measured:

1. [[electrophysiological brain activity]] (EA)
2. [[biochemical brain activity]] (BA)
3. [[metabolic brain activity]] (MA).

Next, we make a distinction between techniques that use:

1. [[passive sensing]] (PS)
2. [[active sensing]] (AS).
