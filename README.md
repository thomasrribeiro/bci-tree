We explore various non-invasive methods for measuring brain activity. 

Our first distinction is based on the type of brain activity being measured:

1. [[electrophysiological brain activity]] (EA)
2. [[biochemical brain activity]] (BA)
3. [[metabolic brain activity]] (MA).

Next, we make a distinction between techniques that use:

1. [[passive sensing]] (PS)
2. [[active sensing]] (AS).

We also make a distinction between modalities that can generate and/or detect an:

1. [[electric field]] (EF)
2. [[magnetic field]] (MF)
3. [[electromagnetic field]] (EMF)
4. [[acoustic field]] (AF)

Below is our tiling tree:
