An **acoustic field** is a scalar or vector field that describes the propagation of pressure variations and particle motion in a compressible medium due to mechanical vibrations. These variations can be described based on the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], the [[continuity equation]], and the [[pressure-density relation]].
