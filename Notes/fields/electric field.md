An **electric field** is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge due to the presence of other electric charges. Electric fields can be generated by:

1. the presence of an electric charge ([[Gauss' law]])
2. a changing magnetic field ([[Faraday's law]])
3. moving charges or electromagnetic waves ([[Amp√®re-Maxwell's law]])
