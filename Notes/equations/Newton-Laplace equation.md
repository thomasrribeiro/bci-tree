The **Newton-Laplace equation** gives the speed of sound in a compressible medium. Formally: $$c=\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}$$ where:
- $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, measured in meters per second $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$,
- $K$ is the bulk modulus of elasticity, measured in pascals $\text{Pa}$, which measures how resistant the medium is to compression,
- $\rho$ is the density of the medium, measured in kilograms per cubic meter $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}$.
