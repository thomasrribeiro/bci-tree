**Amp√®re's law with Maxwell's correction** describes how magnetic fields are generated by electric currents and changing electric fields. Formally: $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathbf{E}$$
where:
- $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the magnetic field (or magnetic flux density), measured in tesla, $\text{T} = \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A}\cdot\text{m}}$,
- $\mathbf{x}$ represents the position vector in three-dimensional space, typically expressed as $\mathbf{x}=(x,y,z)$, measured in meters, $\text{m}$,
- $t$ is time, measured in seconds, $\text{s}$,
- $\nabla$ is the nabla symbol that denotes the three-dimensional gradient operator,
- $\nabla \times$ denotes the curl operator, which measures the rotation of a field in space, and which when applied to $\mathbf{B}$ is: $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}B_z - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}B_y\right)\mathbf{i} + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}B_x - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}B_z\right)\mathbf{j} + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}B_y - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}B_x\right)\mathbf{k},$$ measured in amperes per meter, $\frac{\text{A}}{\text{m}}$,
- $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, measured in henry per meter, $\frac{\text{H}}{\text{m}} = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A}^2}$,
- $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the current density, measured in amperes per square meter, $\frac{\text{A}}{\text{m}^2}$,
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space measured in farads per meter, $\frac{\text{F}}{\text{m}} = \frac{\text{C}^2}{(\text{N}\cdot \text{m}^2)}$,
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ represents the partial derivative operator with respect to time $t$,
- $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the electric field, measured in volts per meter, $\frac{\text{V}}{\text{m}}$.

Alternatively, in integral form: $$\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mu_0\int_S \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{A} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\int_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$$ where:
- $C$ represents a closed loop or contour in space,
- $\oint_C$ represents a line integral around the closed path $C$, measuring the total circulation of the electric field along the loop,
- $d\mathbf{s}$ is a differential line element that represents an infinitesimally small segment along the loop $C$,
- $\frac{d}{dt}$ represents the time derivative operator, indicating how a quantity changes over time,
- $S$ is a surface whose boundary is the closed loop $C$,
- $\int_S$ represents a surface integral, which sums the contribution of the field $\mathbf{B}$ over the entire surface $S$, 
- $d\mathbf{A}$ is a differential surface element, representing an infinitesimally small patch of the surface $S$.
