**Gauss' law for magnetism** states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero. Formally: 
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
where:
- $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the magnetic field (or magnetic flux density), measured in tesla $\text{T} = \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A}\cdot\text{m}}$,
- $\mathbf{x}$ represents the position vector in three-dimensional space, typically expressed as $\mathbf{x}=(x,y,z)$, measured in meters $\text{m}$,
- $t$ is time, measured in seconds $\text{s}$,
- $\nabla$ is the nabla symbol that denotes the three-dimensional gradient operator,
- $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the **divergence operator**, which measures the net flux of a field out of an infinitesimal volume, and which when applied to $\mathbf{B}$ is:$$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}B_x + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}B_y + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}B_z.$$
Alternatively, in integral form: $$\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0$$ where:
- $S$ represents a closed surface,
- $\oint_S$ represents a surface integral, 
- $d\mathbf{A}$ is a differential surface element that represents an infinitesimally small patch of the surface $S$.
