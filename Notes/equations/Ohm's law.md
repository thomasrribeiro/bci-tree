**Ohm's law** is an empirical law that states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. In vector form: $$\mathbf{J}=\sigma\mathbf{E}$$ where:
- $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the current density, measured in amperes per square meter, $\frac{\text{A}}{\text{m}^2}$,
- $\mathbf{x}$ represents the position vector in three-dimensional space, typically expressed as $\mathbf{x}=(x,y,z)$, measured in meters $\text{m}$,
- $t$ is time, measured in seconds $\text{s}$,
- $\sigma(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the conductivity, measured in siemens per meter $\frac{\text{S}}{\text{m}}$,
- $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the electric field, measured in volts per meter $\frac{\text{V}}{\text{m}}$.
