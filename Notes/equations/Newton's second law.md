**Newton's second law**, in modern form, states that the rate of change of the momentum of an object is equal to the net force acting on it. Formally, it is expressed as: $$\mathbf{F}=\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{p}$$ where:
- $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the net force applied to the object, measured in newtons, $\text{N}$,
- $t$ is time, measured in seconds, $\text{s}$,
- $\frac{d}{d t}$ represents the derivative operator with respect to time $t$,
- $\mathbf{p}(t)=m\mathbf{v}$ is the linear momentum, measured in kilogram meter per second, $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{s}}$,
- $m$ is the mass, measured in kilograms, $\text{kg}$,
- $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the velocity, measured in meters per second, $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$.
