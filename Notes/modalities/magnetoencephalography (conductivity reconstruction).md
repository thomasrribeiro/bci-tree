**Magnetoencephalography conductivity reconstruction** is a *proposed* [[passive sensing]] technique that measures [[electrophysiological brain activity]] by reconstructing changes in conductivity due to primary current sources from from [[magnetic field]] recordings on the scalp obtained using [[magnetoencephalography]].

# Theory

Analogous to [[electroencephalogram (conductivity reconstruction)]].
