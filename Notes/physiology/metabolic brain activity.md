**Metabolic brain activity** refers to the energy production and utilization processes that sustain neuronal function. Key metabolic processes include:

1. Blood flow regulation
	- ensures oxygen and glucose delivery to active regions
2. Glucose metabolism
	- primary energy source for neurons
3. Oxygen consumption
	- used in oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria
4. ATP production and energy transfer
	- via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation
5. Lactate production
	- astrocytes provide lactate as an alternative fuel
