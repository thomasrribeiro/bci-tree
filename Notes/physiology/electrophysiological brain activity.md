**Electrophysiological brain activity** refers to the electrical signals in the brain generated by neurons. We differentiate between:

1. Primary currents (direct result of neural activity)

	1. Action potentials currents
		- ~1-2 ms duration
		- propagate along the axon of the neuron
		- caused by sodium and potassium ion flows across axonal membrane

	2. Post-synaptic currents
		- 10-100ms duration
		- occur at dendrites and soma when neurons receives synaptic input
		- caused by neurotransmitters binding to receptors which creates ion flow
		- summation in space and time

2. Secondary currents (induced by primary currents):

	1. Volume conduction currents
		- Brain is a conductive medium so electric potentials spread through tissues to surrounding neural structures (gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, scalp)
