**Biochemical brain activity** refers to the chemical processesÂ that regulate neuronal communication and brain function. Key biochemical processes include:

1. Neurotransmission (release and uptake of neurotransmitters)
	- Glutamate (excitatory)
	- GABA (inhibitory)
	- Dopamine (reward, motivation, motor control)
	- Serotonin (mood, sleep, appetite)
	- Acetylcholine (learning, memory, attention)

2. Ion channel regulation
	- Ion gradients (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-) which drive action potentials and synaptic transmission
